# A Minute keyboard

_"Abandon all QWERTY or DVORAK layouts, use a minimal software mapped keyboard."_

A really minute splited software mapped keyboard, using two pads of twelve (6x2) switches.

# Only 12 + 12 keys !

The Minute keyboard is a new aprouch of The Uni, https://github.com/petercpark/The_Uni, from stenograpfy to typewriter and reduced to only 24 keys, with partial design from ErgoDOx.

Only 24 keys for all ASCII chars, grouped as 33 control, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase, 10 digits, 32 symbols ?

Also for special functions keys (PgUp, PgDn, Up, Down, Left, Right, Cut, Copy, Paste, Ins, Home, End, Find, Replace, Mark, Erase, Undo, Clear, Menu, Quit, Open, Close, etc)  

Also for specific dedicaded tasks as games, mouse, drawing, stations, etc ?
# Make it simple 

Mouse solution: 

    Solved using three types of touch: one (select), two (action), hold (moves).

Keyboard solution:
    
    Reserve four keys as Alternate, Shift, Numeric, Control, as HID defined. 

    Those are used for combos, double click holds the state, for use in sequences of keys.
    
# 12 + 12 really ?

Assign 20 keys.

Combine Alt, Shf as (none, Alt, Shf, Shf Alt), 
    then 20 * 4  = 80 combos

Combine Num, Ctr as (None, Num, Ctr, Num Ctr), 
    then 20 * 4 * 4 = 320 combos

Sixteen keyboard maps of 20 keys. Total de 320 combos keys !

Think as that maps are layout layers over same  designed  keys.

# Reasoning

"The behavior should not astonish or surprise users"
Principle of least astonishment, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment

The fingers index, middle, ring and pinky moves up/down, index and pinky also moves left/rigth.

Confortable no thumb movement.

Modifiers keys Alt Num at left hand, and Ctrl Shf right hand.

and none, one touch, two touch as switches, and combos.

each other key could be mapped into multiple values that depends of modifiers states.

# Mapped Keyboards

All operational systems allow software mapping for keyboard, some keyboards do mapping inside.

But which keys layout ? A historical QWERTY or a revised DVORAK ? 

Or reviews like Colemak https://colemak.com/, or Halmak https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak or Workman https://workmanlayout.org/ ?

Or a layout based on frequencies and finger movements, in classic or personal chosen texts, from Carpalx http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/ ?

All those are most based in thousands of classic texts, maybe from centuries ago, but today where we can search and analyse thousands texts ? Answer is Google. https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html. 

The n-gram analysis are already done in http://www.norvig.com/mayzner.html and a confortable layout in https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202103.0287/v1, explained at https://engram.dev/

The engram layout for a classic five rows by 58 keys or ergonomic five rows by 62 keys.

"By ETAOIN SRHLDCU !", the _minute keyboard_ must envolve and simplify it for 20 keys in 16 mapped layouts. 

The good point ? The minute does not need old layouts adaptative training, it's a complete new aprouch.

Where is the keyboard mapped layouts ?
