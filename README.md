# Minute keyboard

    A really minute splited software mapped keyboard, using two pads of 6x2 switches.

    Abandon all QWERTY or DVORAK layouts, use a minimal software mapped keyboard.

# By design

    Keyboards could be staggered or gridded or ortholinear and splitted.

# All keyboards

In a common lowercase keyboard, using ASCII characters table, some special keys that access groups of characters or a specific control character.
    
    A Shift (Shf) key access uppercase characters and writer symbols.
    
    A Numeric (Num) key access numbers and math symbols, pherhaps in keypad. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad
    
    A Control (Ctr) key access control characters, those are bellow space character. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character

    A Alternate (Alt) key for functions or access UniCode or UTF-8 tables.

Some Control characters have a dedicated key, Carriage Return (Enter, Crtl-m), Backspace (Ctrl-g), Horizontal Tab (Ctrl-i), Line Feed (Ctrl-j), Escape (Ctrl-[).

A CapsLock key holds and toggles between lowercase and uppercase characters.  

Also Alt and Ctr keys are used for shortcuts in applications menus as definided keybindings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut

Many keyboards have extra functionalities mapped with extra keys ( Meta, AltGr, Win, Fn, Menu, etc).

In any case a keyboard could be in diferent states, as keys are software mapped to dedicated functions.

As writer, keys are placed in text; As editor, keys controls movements over  text; As gamer, keys are actions in  game; As ilustrator, keys are actions to compose  image; etc

# chords and combos

"there are groups for Typing, Control, Function, Navigation, Numeric"

By definition, a chord is pressing keys at same time, a combo is pressing keys in sequence.

Usually a shortcut is pressing two keys at same time, as Shf+Q or Ctr+Q and a toggle alternate between modes of keys, as CapsLock.

chords (simultaneous) or strikes (in order) ?

I prefer make sequences because hitting one key at at time is easier than hitting 
two keys at the same time.
# Only 12 + 12 keys !

Only 24 keys for all ASCII chars, grouped as 33 control, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase, 10 digits, 32 symbols.

Also for special functions keys (PgUp, PgDn, Up, Down, Left, Right, Cut, Copy, Paste, Ins, Home, End, Find, Replace, Mark, Erase, Undo, Clear, Menu, Quit, Open, Close,)  

Also for specific dedicaded taks as games, mouse, drawing, stations, etc
# Make it simple 

Mouse solution: 

    Solved using three types of touch: one (select), two (action), hold (moves).

Keyboard solution:
    
    Reserve four keys as Alt, Shift, Numeric, Control. 

    Those are used for combos, double click holds the state, for use in sequence of keys
    


# 12 + 12 really ?

Combine Alt, Shift as (none, Alt, Shift, Shift Alt), 
    then 20 * 4  = 80 combos

Combine Num, Ctrl as (Num, Ctrl, Num Edit), 
    then 80 * 3 = 240 combos

Sixteen keyboard maps of 20 keys. Total de 320 combos !

Most used symbols are distributed

# Reasoning

"The behavior should not astonish or surprise users"
Principle of least astonishment, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment



fingers index, middle, ring and pinky moves up/down, 

index and pinky also moves left/rigth, no thumb movement

meta keys Alt, Num at left and Ctrl, Shf right hand 



and none, one touch, two touch as switches, and combos

maped strikes M1-Num, M1-Ctrl, M1-Meta, Num-M1, Num-Ctrl, Num-Meta, 

Ctrl-M1, Ctrl-Num, Ctrl-Meta, Meta-M1, Meta-Num, Meta-Ctrl

each other key be mapped as  multiple values that depends of meta state

# Mapped Keyboards

All operational systems allow software mapping for keyboard
