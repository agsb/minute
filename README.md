# A Minute keyboard 

 _this project is a work in progress,still just ideas and thoughts, not finished, please be patient_

[_"Abandon all QWERTY all ye who enter here"_](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180521-why-we-cant-give-up-this-odd-way-of-typing)

Forget QWERTY and etc layouts, use a minimal software mapped keyboard.

A really minute splited layered software mapped keyboard, using two pads of up to ten (5x2) switches.

Inspired in [Sweep]Alike [Many Splited]( https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards) or reduced splited [Ergogen](https://github.com/topics/ergogen) and [Cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino/blob/master/readme.md)

__Now learning to use Ergogen to create it.__

Also look at [Mother of All Demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos)

### Left and Right

# Make it simple

[_"The behavior should not astonish or surprise users"_,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)

All operational systems allow software mapping for keyboard, and keyboards can do mapping inside.

Minute let any key act as single press (click), fast dual clicky (dual tap), keep press (held). All keys acts as modifiers. No auto-repeat allowed.

Some complementary and [random notes](https://github.com/agsb/minute/tree/main/notes) about frequencies, layouts, combos and dances.

Minute is not a chorded keyboard, as [stenotype](https://www.artofchording.com/) keyboard. 

To be more confortable, no lateral finger movement, no pinky efforts.
~~The index and pinky also moves left/rigth one key.~~

The fingers index, middle, ring and thumb moves between two rows, pinky is one row only. Use any key as modifier. 

# Keyboard Layout

__"By ETAOIN SRHLDCU !"__

Romak[https://github.com/rafaelromao/romak] takes the layout to a confortable experience of use and easy learn.

The [Engram](https://engram.dev/) is systematic approach for confortable keyboard layout, done by [Arno Klein](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202103.0287/v1), for classic 58 keys or 68 ergonomic keyboards, but with a confortable split layout as [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku).

But only 24 keys ? Updated: [Ben Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RN_4PQ0j1A) [does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKfeJrRIcxw) with [less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAUxTR4vGys)!

The _minute keyboard_ simplifies Engram layout, for 18 keys, in less than 16 mapped layouts.
