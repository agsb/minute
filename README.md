# minute

    A really minute spplited software mapped keyboard

# By design

    Keyboards could be staggered or gridded or ortholinear and splitted.

# All keyboards

In a common lowercase keyboard, there are special keys that access groups of characters or a specific control character.
    
    A Shift (shf) key access uppercase characters and writer symbols.
    
    A Numeric (num) key access numbers and math symbols, pherhaps in keypad. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad
    
    A Control (ctr) key access control characters, those are bellow space character. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character

    A Alternate (alt) key access over ASCII character table, as UniCode or UTF-8 tables.

Some Control characters have a specifc key as Carriage Return (Enter, Crtl-m), Backspace (Ctrl-g), Horizontal Tab (Ctrl-i), Line Feed (Ctrl-j), Escape (Ctrl-[). 

TA Caps Lock key holds sft state, and toggles between lowercase and uppercase chars.  

In any case a keyboard could be in diferent states, as keys are software mapped to dedicated functions. 

As writer, keys are placed in text; As editor, keys controls movements over  text; As gamer, keys are actions in  game; As ilustrator, keys are actions to compose  image; etc

A especific Alt key is used to extended the ASCII character table by compose a numeric sequence for access UniCode or UTF-8 characters maps.

Also alt and ctr keys are used for shortcuts in applications menus as definided keybindings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut


Many keyboards have extra functionalities mapped with extra keys ( Meta, Alt Gray, ).

# shortcuts, chords, combos and toggles

By definition, a shortcut is pressing two keys at same time, a chord is pressing more than two keys at same time, a combo is pressing keys in sequence, a toggle alternate between modes of keys.


# Only 12 + 12 keys !

Only 24 keys for all ASCII chars, grouped as 33 control, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase, 10 digits, 32 symbols.

Also for special functions keys (PgUp, PgDn, Up, Down, Left, Right, Cut, Copy, Paste, Ins, Home, End, Find, Replace, Mark, Erase, Undo, Clear, Menu, Quit, Open, Close,)  

Also for specific dedicaded taks as games, mouse, drawing, stations, etc
# Make it simple 

Mouse solution: 

    Solved using three types of touch: one (select), two (action), hold (moves).

Keyboard solution:
    
    Reserve four keys as Alt, Shift, Numeric, Control. 
    
    In a common lowercase keyboard, there are special keys that access groups of characters or a specific control character.
    
    A Shift key access uppercase characters and writer symbols.
    
    A Numeric key access numbers and math symbols, pherhaps in keypad.
    
    A Control key access control character, those are bellow space character.

    Some Control characters have a specifc key as Carriage Return (Enter, Crtl-m), Backspace (Ctrl-g), Horizontal Tab (Ctrl-i), Line Feed (Ctrl-j), Escape (Ctrl-[)

    Those are used for combos

    double click holds the state, for use in sequence of keys
    
    keyboard mapped software and modifiers

# 12 + 12 really ?

Combine Alt, Shift as (none, Alt, Shift, Shift Alt), 
    then 20 * 4  = 80 combos

Combine Num, Ctrl as (Num, Ctrl, Num Edit), 
    then 80 * 3 = 240 combos

Sixteen keyboard maps of 20 keys. Total de 320 combos !

Most used symbols are distributed

# Reasoning

"The behavior should not astonish or surprise users"
Principle of least astonishment, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment



fingers index, middle, ring and pinky moves up/down, 

index and pinky also moves left/rigth, no thumb movement

meta keys Alt, Num at left and Ctrl, Shf right hand 

chords (simultaneous) or strikes (in order) ?

make sequences because hitting one key at at time is easier than hitting 
two keys at the same time.

and none, one touch, two touch as switches, and combos

maped strikes M1-Num, M1-Ctrl, M1-Meta, Num-M1, Num-Ctrl, Num-Meta, 

Ctrl-M1, Ctrl-Num, Ctrl-Meta, Meta-M1, Meta-Num, Meta-Ctrl

each other key be mapped as  multiple values that depends of meta state

# Mapped Keyboards

All operational systems allow software mapping for keyboard
