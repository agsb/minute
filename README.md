# Minute keyboard

_"Abandon all QWERTY or DVORAK layouts, use a minimal software mapped keyboard."_

A really minute splited software mapped keyboard, using two pads of 6x2 switches.

# By design

_"Today, most full-size keyboards use one of three different mechanical layouts, usually referred to as simply ISO (ISO/IEC 9995-2), ANSI (ANSI-INCITS 154-1988), and JIS (JIS X 6002-1980)"_, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard

Keyboards could be staggered or gridded or ortholinear and splitted, also stenotype and chorded. 

Human Interface Definition - HID, as USB HID interface BIOS implementations only defines 8 modifier keys, usually Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and Win at left and right.

Eletronics see a key as Column by Line, keys jamming and ghosting can be prevented by adding diodes at lines. Best technology is  "n-key rollover" (NKRO), this means that each key is scanned completely independently by the keyboard hardware. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(keyboard)

Keyboards could be membrane or mechanic keys switches, they have diferent pressure actuation varing from 55-75g to 25-55g 
# All keyboards

In a common lowercase keyboard, using ASCII characters table, some special keys that access groups of characters or a specific control character.
    
    A Shift (Shf) key access uppercase characters and writer symbols.
    
    A Numeric (Num) key access numbers and math symbols, pherhaps in keypad. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad
    
    A Control (Ctr) key access control characters, those are bellow space character. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character

    A Alternate (Alt) key for functions or access UniCode or UTF-8 tables.

Some Control characters have a dedicated key, Carriage Return (Enter, Crtl-m), Backspace (Ctrl-g), Horizontal Tab (Ctrl-i), Line Feed (Ctrl-j), Escape (Ctrl-[).

A CapsLock key holds and toggles between lowercase and uppercase characters.  

Also Alt and Ctr keys are used for shortcuts in applications menus as definided keybindings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut

Many keyboards have extra functionalities mapped with extra keys ( Meta, Opt, Cmd, AltGr, Win, Fn, Menu, etc).

In any case a keyboard could be in diferent states, as keys are software mapped to dedicated functions.

As writer, keys are placed in text; As editor, keys controls movements over  text; As gamer, keys are actions in  game; As ilustrator, keys are actions to compose  image; etc

# chords and combos

"there are groups keys for Typing, Control, Function, Navigation, Numeric"

By definition, a chord is pressing keys at same time, a combo is pressing keys in sequence.

Usually a shortcut is pressing two keys at same time, as Shf+Q or Ctr+Q and a toggle alternate between modes of keys, as CapsLock.

What is better chords (simultaneous) or combos (sequences) ?

Why stenography is faster ? It records sounds and uses chords to combos convertion. "The order that you press them down in doesn't matter, only which keys you hit is important." https://www.artofchording.com/ and http://www.openstenoproject.org/

I prefer make combos because hitting one key at at time is easier than hitting 
two keys at the same time.
# Only 12 + 12 keys !

Only 24 keys for all ASCII chars, grouped as 33 control, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase, 10 digits, 32 symbols.

Also for special functions keys (PgUp, PgDn, Up, Down, Left, Right, Cut, Copy, Paste, Ins, Home, End, Find, Replace, Mark, Erase, Undo, Clear, Menu, Quit, Open, Close,)  

Also for specific dedicaded taks as games, mouse, drawing, stations, etc
# Make it simple 

Mouse solution: 

    Solved using three types of touch: one (select), two (action), hold (moves).

Keyboard solution:
    
    Reserve four keys as Alt, Shift, Numeric, Control. 

    Those are used for combos, double click holds the state, for use in sequence of keys
    


# 12 + 12 really ?

Combine Alt, Shift as (none, Alt, Shift, Shift Alt), 
    then 20 * 4  = 80 combos

Combine Num, Ctrl as (Num, Ctrl, Num Edit), 
    then 80 * 3 = 240 combos

Sixteen keyboard maps of 20 keys. Total de 320 combos !

Most used symbols are distributed

# Reasoning

"The behavior should not astonish or surprise users"
Principle of least astonishment, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment



fingers index, middle, ring and pinky moves up/down, 

index and pinky also moves left/rigth, no thumb movement

meta keys Alt, Num at left and Ctrl, Shf right hand 



and none, one touch, two touch as switches, and combos

maped strikes M1-Num, M1-Ctrl, M1-Meta, Num-M1, Num-Ctrl, Num-Meta, 

Ctrl-M1, Ctrl-Num, Ctrl-Meta, Meta-M1, Meta-Num, Meta-Ctrl

each other key be mapped as  multiple values that depends of meta state

# Mapped Keyboards

All operational systems allow software mapping for keyboard
