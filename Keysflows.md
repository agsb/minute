## frequency studies

Many essays about letters, symbols, n-grams in diferent types of texts or tasks

using dead keys: LSHF, LCTR, LALT, LGUI, RSHF, RCTR, RALT, RGUI;

using tap-hold modifiers: one tap, double tap, hold, tap hold;

usually SHF does lowercase to uppercase, CTR does control codes ;

usually ALT and GUI does extra codes;

groups from 127 ASCII: lowercase 26, upercase 26, control 32, symbols 43

optimal keyboard 2 x 3 x 5 

diacriticals: use a symbol and a letter to extra letters as ´ a á

layouts are mapped as layers and selected by tap-hold modifiers.

### Sentence lenght

Average words by phrase is about 14-24, a good size is around 20. Less than 14 get 100% compreension and more than 42 get just 10%. Sentences of 12 words are easy to read. [1]

### Metrics

to find a metric:

make relative costs based in order, taps, holds, layouts.

make costs equal to inverse frequency or less acurate order
