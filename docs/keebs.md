# Design and Layout

The Minute were designed to use combination of keys, called chords in stenotypes, and timed touch to hold or dual-tap, for doing combos.

The Layers have 12 keys each, grouped together for ease of use and visual reference. 
For example, _T H E A N D_ is better than _E T A N D H_

The digits, semicolons and commas were grouped together in the same _numeric_ layer. The letters q and z were grouped together with other symbols in the _low usage_ layer.

The letters at _default_ layer occurs in about 75% of all words. The letters uses two layers and stay selected until changes.

The symbols uses threee layers, (always) active only for next key pressed. 

## Groups

The Minute is splited in two pads, left and right, each groups of six keys (A, for ring-middle-index), two keys (B, for thumb), and one key (C, for pinky). 

For easy, the pinky keys are always used for **shift**. With one tap, shifts the next key, dual tap acts as **Caps-Lock**, on or off, and hold acts as in any common qwerty keyboard. 

At ring-middle-index keys, any key acts like a shift for layers, changes the active layer (1 to 6) while held. Use one hand to select layer and other to select key.

| ring | middle | index || index | middle | ring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 5 | 4 || 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 || 1 | 2 | 3 |
| | | | | | |

The thumb keys, are called M0, M1, M2, M4, does a dance as

| Key | Layer 0 | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tap | | | | | 
| M0 | Space | | |
| M1 | Enter | | |
| M2 | Layer Up | | |
| M3 | Layer Dn | | |
| hold | | | | |
| M0 |  | | |
| M1 |  | | |
| M2 |  | | |
| M3 |  | | |
| dual tap | | | | |
| M0 |  | | |
| M1 |  | | |
| M2 | | | |
| M3 | | | |
| | | | | 

the two pads of six keystwelve 

### Layers


The order of layers could be changed
### Limitations

The order of letters inside layers is not yet adjusted or balanced finger use.

For sake of use "hold and tap", no automatic key repeat allowed, (maybe as combo ?)
