# Design and Layout

The Minute were designed to use combination of keys, called chords in stenotypes, and timed touchs for hold or tip-and-tap, all for doing combos.

The letters at first layer (1) occurs in about 75% of all words. 

Some layers swap letters, for sake of easy visual and use. 
eg. all digits at same layer, period and comma grouped at digits layer (0), q and z grouped at low used layer. 

## Limitations

The order of letters inside layers is not yet adjusted or balanced finger use.

For sake of use "hold and tap", no automatic key repeat allowed, (maybe as combo ?)
