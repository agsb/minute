# Design and Layout

The Minute were designed to use combination of keys, called chords in stenotypes, and timed touchs for hold or tip-and-tap, all for doing combos.

The layers are defined for sake of easy visual and use. 
eg. all digits at same layer, period and comma grouped at digits layer (0), q and z grouped at low used layer. 

The letters at default layer occurs in about 75% of all words. The letters uses two layers and stay selected until changes.

The digits, period and comma, in one layer and stay select for digits

The symbols uses threee layers, (always) active only for next key pressed. 

## Groups

The Minute is splited in two pads, left and right, each groups of six keys (A, for ring-middle-index), two keys (B, for thumb), and one key (C, for pinky). 

For easy, the pinky keys are always **shift**, as in any qwerty keyboard. Dual tap acts as **Caps-Lock**, on or off.

At ring-middle-index keys, any key changes the active layer while holded, acts like a shift key but for layers.

| ring | middle | index || index | middle | ring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 5 | 4 || 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 || 1 | 2 | 3 |
| | | | | | |

The thumb keys, are called M0, M1, M2, M4, does a dance as

| Key | Layer 0 | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Space | | |
| M1 | Enter | | |
| M2 | Layer Up | | |
| M2 | (hold) | | |
| M3 | Layer Dn | | |
| M3 | (hold) | | |
| | | | | 

the two pads of six keystwelve 

### Layers


The order of layers could be changed
### Limitations

The order of letters inside layers is not yet adjusted or balanced finger use.

For sake of use "hold and tap", no automatic key repeat allowed, (maybe as combo ?)
