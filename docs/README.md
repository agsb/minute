## What 

This directory group some essays and ideas around development of 
the [Minute](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/Minute.md) keyboard.

## Why

Aoccdrnig to rscheearch at Cmabirgde Uinervtisy, it
deosnâ€™t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are,
the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer
be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a ttoal mses and
you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the
huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the
wrod as a wlohe. [Amzanig huh](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361/lecture35.pdf)?

## Simplify.

The QWERTY layout comes out from mechanical time of technology. 
It is ergonomic disastrous, cause multiple injuries and is not optmized for humans.

Modern keyboards are ortholinear and splited, with more combos than shift-something.
The use of Shift, Control, Alter and Meta keys as modifiers allow define more keys,  in virtual layers, than physicaly exists.

But many modern designs and layouts still preserve qwerty features.

How optimze and simplify ?

Some notes about [Logics](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/Logics.md), [Design](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/Design.md) and [Layout](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/Layouts.md)

## How

Using combinations of keys, aka combos, and a confortable design for an alternative layout,
and not a stenotype keyboard [1].

### Frequency

A alternative letter [frequency correlation analysis](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/Frequency.md), gives the follow sequence, using sequencial order of letters in most used word and most used bi-grams with space.

#### alpha

**t a o e h n d i b f s r y l w u c m p g k v j x q z**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| t | a | o | e | h | n | d | i | b | f | s | r | y | l | w | u | c | m | p | g | k | v | j | x | q | z |

#### punctuations

**_ , . ) ( * ; - = / " # > { } ' \ : & [ ] < + ! @ ? | % ` ~ $ ^**

 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | | | | | |

#### digits

**0 1 2 3 4 8 5 6 9 7**

## Extras

For reference this is the ordened list for corpus. (S space, T tabulation, A new-line)
