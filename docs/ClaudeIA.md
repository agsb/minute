First attempet:

Certainly. I'll create groups of 12 elements each, using the full ASCII character set 
in order of frequency of use in English. This will include letters (both lowercase and uppercase), 
digits, punctuation, and common symbols.

Group 1 (Highest frequency):
e t a o i n s r h l d c

Group 2:
u m f p g w y b , . v k

Group 3:
- " x ' j q z 0 1 2 3 4

Group 4:
5 6 7 8 9 ! ? ) ( : ; /

Group 5:
@ _ [ ] * % ^ & + = ~ `

Group 6:
A T I S N C H O R D L E

Group 7:
M U F P G W Y B V K X J

Group 8:
Q Z < > | \ # $ € £ ¥ ©

This grouping follows these principles:

1. Lowercase letters come first, as they're generally more frequent in English text.
2. Numbers and punctuation are interspersed based on their frequency of use.
3. Uppercase letters follow, in roughly the same order as their lowercase counterparts.
4. Less common symbols and special characters are placed at the end.

Note that the exact order can vary slightly depending on the corpus used for frequency analysis, 
but this grouping should give a good general representation of character frequency in English text.

Would you like me to explain any part of this grouping in more detail?

you forgot the letters q and z.

new set:

```
Group 1 (Most common lowercase letters):
e t a o i n s r h l d c
Group 2 (Next most common lowercase letters):
u m f p g w y b v k x j
Group 3 (Least common lowercase letters):
q z
Group 4 (Common punctuation):
, . - ' " : ; ! ? ( ) /
Group 5 (All digits):
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Group 6 (Common symbols):
@ # $ % & * + = _ [ ]
Group 7 (Less common symbols):
{ } < > | \ ^ ~ ` € £ ¥
