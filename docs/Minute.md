# Minute 

    _The long tail phenomenon hides the entropy of letter frequency_. 

__Minute__ is a reduced keyboard, splited and orthogonal, with roll-over for twelve "letters" keys plus six "action" keys. 

Inspired in [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris), [Corne Sweep](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd),  and [Giorgi](https://github.com/germ/qmk_firmware/tree/georgi/keyboards/georgi) using [Art of Chording](https://www.artofchording.com/). Related to [UT22](https://github.com/bubbleology/UT22), [Artseys](https://artsey.io/), [Taipo](https://inkeys.wiki/en/keymaps/taipo) and [Posh](https://inkeys.wiki/en/keymaps/posh) but layered not chorded.

Based like a stenotype without glyphs, with a [design by frequency](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/Frequency.md) of **most used letters in most used words**. 

Why twelve keys for letters ? The first twelve letters accounts for about 80% of all letters used in english. __"Use Pareto, Luke"__

Why six keys for actions ? For combos, like Space, Enter, Tabulation, Backspace, Delete actions and Shift, Control, Alter, Meta and layers modifiers.

All keys could do "held-taps" dances.
