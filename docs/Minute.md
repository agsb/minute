# Minute 

_The long tail phenomenon hides the entropy of letter frequency_. 

__Minute__ is a reduced keyboard, splited and orthogonal, with roll-over for twelve "letters" keys plus six "action" keys.

Based on [design by frequency](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/Frequency.md) of letters in most used words. 

Why twelve keys for letters ? The first twelve letters accounts for about 80% of all letters use. __"Use Pareto, Luke"__

Why six keys for actions ? For "hold-taps-dances" combos.
