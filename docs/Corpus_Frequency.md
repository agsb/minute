# Corpus Frequency Analysis

## From Mixed Corpus

A basic statistical review with absolute **counter, [SFI](http://www.manulex.org/docs/en/Manulex.pdf), percents, cumulatives frequencies,** were done with corpus of texts from

[Engram](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/stats.engram.md)

[Linux kernel](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/stats.linux.md)

[OpenJDK](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/stats.openjava.md)

[Project Guttenberg](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/stats.guttenberg.md)

[Oxford Text Archive](https://github.com/agsb/minute/blob/main/docs/stats.engram.md)

Those results are tabulated and results in a line of ordened characters for each corpus. 
then summing the relative positions a character in each line, results in a weight ordered line where less is better.

## count in order and sum

ASCII characters, Space is (S), Enter is (A) and Tabulation is (T)
