## About Layouts

But which layout ? A historical QWERTY or revised DVORAK ?

Or others, like [Colemak](https://colemak.com/), [Halmak](https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak), [Workman](https://workmanlayout.org/) 

Or a layout based on frequencies and finger movements, in classic or personal chosen texts, from [Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/), from [Arensito](http://www.pvv.org/~hakonhal/main.cgi/keyboard), from [Norman](https://normanlayout.info/), some good reviews at [workman](https://www.workmanlayout.com/).

All those are most based in thousands of classic texts, maybe from centuries and Google makes available at <https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html>, also [Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists](http://wordlist.aspell.net/)

There is a [letter frequency](https://letterfrequency.org) and a [word frequency](http://www.newgeneralservicelist.org/).

A great frequency analysis was made by [Peter Norvig](http://www.norvig.com/mayzner.html), and [Michael Dickens](https://mdickens.me/typing/theory-of-letter-frequency.html).
